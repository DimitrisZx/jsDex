### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to apply and practice my JavaScript / TypeScript skills for my personal development. It was decided that all the code must be custom written without any lirbaries or frameworks. That decision was made for two reasons. Firstly to understand the problems that libraries and frameworks like React and Angular try to solve. I totally get it. Secondly, it would be a great chance to practice my skills and have fun implementing mechanics that we take for granted now.

It is also the first attempt at setting up test suites with Jest and as such, I am trying to keep my code short and not to tightly couple the various parts. 

Additionally, since the project utilizes TypeScript it is a great opportunity to apply and practice my OOP skills, like classes, interfaces, inheritance (not too much of it though) and composition.

### Approach

Currently, the my approach is to try to replicate features from React & Angular, at least on a conceptual level, that do the job I require them to do. Additionally, I create various helper, mini-libraries which abstract over the standard DOM API to provide an easier and less verbose API for implementing common logic, like creating HTML elements and appending children to them.
